**I'm Worth Hiring**

_To cut to the chase, the only reason you could possibly end up here is that you've read my resume and are trying to glean my breadth of knowledge or quality of code. Let's make this easy._
* 70% of what I've coded was copied from StackOverflow, and variable names were changed.
* 10% of all of my code doesn't work.
* 15% of my code is originial, well-documented and tested code.
* 4% of my code is unused, and is left-over from trying to make another approach work.
* 1% of my code was mashed together at 2AM with a spark of ingenuity, and I genuinely don't understand how it works... but it works.

To build upon this, data drives decisions. As this repo is your primary means of seeing what I'm capable of, I need to make it count.

1. Python Scripts that I have solely created are currently utilized across 6 Discord servers, one enterprise network, and two small businesses (that I do not own)
2. I rely on PyTest to ensure my code works, Flake8 to ensure it's clean, and apply '#noqa C901' liberally.
3. My code is created when I discover a business need; "This process sucks" is the primary driver of new commits. I've also fallen victim to management requests, but those are far less extensive.


It shouldn't need to be said that the purpose of hiring an individual with experience in Python is to save time; be it mangement's, engineering's, sales', etc.. Any script I write is to done in order to save time to accelerate a schedule, to give myself five minutes back every day, or ensure I can exceed my project schedule. My experience has given me an innumerable amount of situations that I've had to manage around deploy with or against, and that skill translates globally.

For what it's worth, I prefer Juniper; _commit confirm_
